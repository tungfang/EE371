# EE371: Design of Digital Circuit and System

6 labs thoroughout the quarter using Altera board and SystemVerilog to design our circuits and systems, and the simulation tool Quartus Prime web edition will be used for simulating and synthesizing designs.

## Lab 1: 
I designed a parking lot occupancy counter as a refresher to the finite state machines that I learned in EE 271.

## Lab 2: 
In computer systems it is necessary to provide a substantial amount of memory. If a system is implementedusing FPGA technology, it is possible to provide some amount of memory by using the memory resources thatexist in the FPGA device. In this lab I examined the general issues involved in implementing such memory.

## Lab 3: 
Learned how to display images. I used the DE1-SoC Computer’s video-out port to display images on a VGA terminal.

## Lab 4:
Implementing Algorithms in Hardware
Part 1: Implemented the bit-counting circuit using the ASM chart shown in Figure:

Part 2: Implemented a binary search algorithm, which searches through an array to locate an 8-bit value Aspecified via switches SW7−0

## Lab 5: 
Digital Signal Processing
This is an exercise in using the audio coder/decoder (CODEC) on the DE1-SoC board. The lab involves connecting a microphone to the audio CODEC to provide input sound, altering the received sound by filtering out noise, and then playing the resulting sound through speakers/headphones.
